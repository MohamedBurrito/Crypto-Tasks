# Cryptography Algorithms in Python

Welcome to **Cryptography Algorithms in Python**, a repository that implements and explains various classical cryptographic techniques using Python.

This project aims to help beginners and enthusiasts learn about encryption, decryption, and the fundamental concepts of cryptography.

## üìú Description  
In this repository, you'll find Python code for several well-known cryptography algorithms, each with detailed examples and instructions for encryption and decryption.

### Current Implementations  

- **Row Transposition Cipher**  
  A classical encryption method that rearranges characters of plaintext into rows and columns based on a keyword.  
  Includes automatic padding with random alphabets if the grid isn't complete.  

- **Rail Fence Cipher**  
  A transposition cipher that writes messages in a zigzag pattern across multiple rails, then reads it row by row.  

- **Vigen√®re Cipher**  
  A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift each letter of the plaintext by varying amounts.  

- **Caesar Cipher**  
  One of the simplest encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  

- **Monoalphabetic Cipher**  
  A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a unique corresponding letter in the ciphertext, based on a fixed key.  

- **Playfair Cipher**  
  A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters using a 5x5 matrix derived from a keyword.
