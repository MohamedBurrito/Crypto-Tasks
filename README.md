# Cryptography Algorithms in Python

Welcome to Cryptography Algorithms in Python, a repository that implements and explains various classical cryptographic techniques in Python. This project aims to help beginners and enthusiasts learn about encryption, decryption, and the fundamental concepts of cryptography.

ðŸ“œ Description
In this repository, you'll find Python code for several well-known cryptography algorithms, each with detailed examples and instructions for encryption and decryption.

Current Implementations:
Row Transposition Cipher

A classical encryption method that rearranges the characters of the plaintext into rows and columns based on a keyword.
Includes automatic padding with random alphabets if the grid isnâ€™t complete.
Rail Fence Cipher

A transposition cipher that writes the message in a zigzag pattern across multiple rails and then reads it row by row.
VigenÃ¨re Cipher

A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift each letter of the plaintext by varying amounts.
Caesar Cipher

One of the simplest encryption techniques where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
Monoalphabetic Cipher

A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a unique corresponding letter in the ciphertext.
Playfair Cipher

A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters based on a 5x5 matrix derived from a keyword.
